### Unit test part 1.
Unit test of a method that verifies that a pattern exists in a file.


The goal of this post is to show how I create unit tests in the java projects I participated as QA tester in the company I work for, for that reason I chose to create this example that is similar to a real case I developed in my job. 
We automate functional testing that tests the functioning of several elements of a big data platform, so we need to make unit tests of that functional testing.

One of the those functional tests executes an hdfs-rm command to delete files in a specific directory called for example "tests" in a path inside a Hadoop Distributed File System if and when that directory "tests" exists. Yes I know, the word "delete" sounds dangerous and it is folks, for that reason our test had to verify that the path was correct. That was the acceptation criteria our Product Owner established to us.
We used a configuration file with the path. 

I like to use the IDE Intellij and mvn to create a mvn archetype (to see what is an mvn archetype and how to build it, check this repo by a QA Enginner friend: [Archetype-Cucumber-TestNG](https://github.com/isortegah/archetype-cucumber-testng).

It was created a project called  "unitestproject".

Under src/test/java/com/carlos/qa/ I create a file "FileManagementTest" where I am going to write the unit tests.

[TDD](https://www.paradigmadigital.com/dev/tdd-como-metodologia-de-diseno-de-software/) says: first write down the test to make it fail. Now, I am going to show first the unit test, make it fail and then create a method that passes the test:

```
import com.carlos.qa.FileManagement;
import org.testng.Assert;
import org.testng.annotations.Test;

public class FileManagementTest {

    public FileManagementTest(){
    }

    @Test(enabled=true) //If false, when the command 'mvn test' is executed this unit test won't be ran.
    public void testVerifyRegexExistsInInputFile(){
        String regexp =".*output.*(\\n.*)*.*path.*\\/tests\\/.*";
        String file ="src/test/resources/configuration.conf";
        boolean result = FileManagement.verifyRegexpExistsInInputFile(file, regexp);
        Assert.assertTrue(result);
    }
}
```
This snippet of code shows a test that validates that a pattern exists in a file through an assertTrue, a method of the class Assert from the framework testng. I imported testng. The tag @Test indicate to maven that the method is a unit test when mvn test phase is executed. The method name describes its goal and the variable regexp is the pattern I want to find inside configuration.conf that is saved in the variable file. It's content is the following:

```
name {
      output {
      type = "avro"
      path = "/com/company/source/hdfs/tests/data.txt"
      mode = "overwrite"
      force = "true"

      schema = {
        path = "dontvalidate"
      }
    }
}

```
Obviously, the pattern is looking for the word "tests" in a line that has the word "path". The variable result stores a boolean result from method FileManagement.verifyRegexpExistsInInputFile. Because the method FileManagement.verifyRegexpExistsInInputFile doesn't exist yet , when I execute the test, I get an error:

To make the test pass I create the class FileManagement and the methods readInputFile and verifyRegexpExistsInInputFile.

```
package com.carlos.qa;

import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import java.util.logging.Level;
import java.util.logging.Logger;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public class FileManagement {

    public FileManagement(){
    }

    public static String readInputFile(String path) {
        String sourcePath = Paths.get(path).toString();
        BufferedReader br = null;
        FileReader fr = null;
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        try {
            fr = new FileReader(sourcePath);
            br = new BufferedReader(fr);
            String line = br.readLine();
            while (line != null) {
                sb.append(line);
                line = br.readLine();
            }
            br.close();
            fr.close();
        } catch (IOException ex) {
            Logger.getLogger(FileManagement.class.getName()).log(Level.SEVERE, "There is no file or directory", ex);
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }

    public static boolean verifyRegexpExistsInInputFile(String file, String regexp) {
        String inputFile = FileManagement.readInputFile(file);
        return Pattern.matches(regexp, inputFile);
    }
}

```

First I write down a method called readInputFile that reads the input file, then the method verifyRegexpExistsInInputFile uses the library Pattern that tests if the variable file matches the pattern (regexp variable).
Now, when I run 
``` mvn test```,
the test pass.
